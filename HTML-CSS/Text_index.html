    <article>Myth: Accessibility is 'blind people'</article>
    Published on January 11, 2013 by Dave Rupert – Updated: November 23, 2018

    <p>
        Accessibility is often viewed as making your site work on screen readers.<br />
        In reality, web accessibility is a subset of User Experience (UX) focused on making your <br />
        websites usable by the widest range of people possible, including those who have disabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Four categories of accessibility</h2>
    Accessibility can be broken down into four key categories:

    <section>
        <h3>Visual</h3>
        This can be non-sighted users, users with low-vision, users with obstructed vision, or even simply your aging parents.
        <ul>
            <li>Associated conditions</li>
            <li>Myopia</li>
            <li>Colour blindness</li>
            <li>Glaucoma</li>
            <li>Albinism</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    
    <section>
        <h3>Auditory</h3>
        <p>The web is a visual medium, but captions and fallbacks for sound-necessary media need to be considered for hearing impaired users.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Associated conditions</li>
            <li>Presbycusis</li>
            <li>Acoustic trauma</li>
            <li>Auditory processing disorder</li>
            <li>Otosclerosis</li>
        </ul>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h3>Motor</h3>
        <p>
            People with motor impairments typically use a wide range of assistive technology from specialized keyboards,<br />
            to eye trackers, to using single buttons (a device known as a “switch”) to navigate their computers.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Associated conditions</li>
            <li>RSI</li>
            <li>Cerebral palsy</li>
            <li>Parkinson’s</li>
            <li>Muscular dystrophy</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h3>Cognitive</h3>
        Relates to the ease processing of information.
        <ul>
            <li>Associated conditions</li>
            <li>Down’s syndrome</li>
            <li>Autism</li>
            <li>Global developmental delay</li>
            <li>Dyslexia</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <p><b><i>Temporary disabilities</i></b></p>
    <p>
        While each of these disabilities is usually permanent, there are often situations <br />
        in which even fully-abled people are “temporarily disabled”.<br />
        For instance, an arm or wrist injury may temporarily prevent you from being able to use a mouse.<br />

        Robin Christopherson (an accessibility expert who is blind) <br />
        once spoke about how people that are driving but use hands-free sets or have their phone connected to the car radio are temporarily disabled,<br />
        as they use the phone differently to how they normally would. <br />
        Of course, no one should browse websites while they are driving but it is important to understand different <br />
        situations like that, where the user may not have special software installed that a disabled user might.
